	Abstract = {Learning complex motor behaviors like riding a bicycle or
              swinging a golf club is based on acquiring neural representations
              of the mechanical requirements of movement (e.g., coordinating
              muscle forces to control the club). Here we provide evidence that
              mechanisms matching observation and action facilitate motor
              learning. Subjects who observed a video depicting another person
              learning to reach in a novel mechanical environment (imposed by a
              robot arm) performed better when later tested in the same
              environment than subjects who observed similar movements but no
              learning; moreover, subjects who observed learning of a different
              environment performed worse. We show that this effect is not
              based on conscious strategies but instead depends on the implicit
              engagement of neural systems for movement planning and control.},
